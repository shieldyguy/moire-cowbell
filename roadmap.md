1. Functional Requirements
Pattern Display
Render large, high-resolution, fine-line SVG patterns.

Patterns must be seamless and endlessly repeatable.

Support multiple pattern types (horizontal, diagonal, concentric, etc.).

Allow layering of two or more patterns for moiré effects.

User Interaction
Drag to translate patterns across the viewport.

Pinch to zoom (scale) patterns in/out.

Rotate patterns with two fingers.

Flick patterns to throw them with inertia and friction.

Double or triple tap gesture to toggle UI (e.g. show/hide pattern selector menu).

Physics Simulation
Momentum-based movement after flick gestures.

Friction to naturally slow down thrown patterns.

Optional loop/wrap-around behavior for infinite scrolling/rotation.

Pattern Library
Built-in pattern presets selectable from a simple UI.

Patterns defined as tiling SVG elements or programmatic canvas graphics.

UI/UX
Minimal overlay UI that doesn’t distract from visual exploration.

Menu system to select and swap patterns.

Possibly a full-screen toggle mode.

Responsive design optimized for mobile (but should scale to desktop gracefully).

2. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: Maintain high frame rate (60fps target).

Scalability: Easy to add more pattern types.

Maintainability: Modular, well-structured codebase.

Accessibility: Touch gestures must work on iOS and Android browsers.

Deployability: Must be deployable on Vercel or similar platforms.

3. Tech Stack
Frontend Framework
Svelte (or Vue.js if preferred)

Simple reactivity model, easy integration with SVG/Canvas.

Fast build and runtime performance.

Animation & Gestures
Interact.js – gesture handling (drag, pinch, rotate).

GSAP – for smooth animations and momentum-based motion.

(Optional: Hammer.js as alternative gesture handler.)

SVG / Pattern Rendering
SVG <pattern> elements for seamless tiling.

Possibly <canvas> for performance-heavy custom patterns.

Programmatic SVG generation or import from Illustrator/Vector tools.

Physics Engine
Matter.js (if physics abstraction is needed for flick/friction).

Or: Lightweight custom velocity/friction handling with requestAnimationFrame.

Deployment
Vercel – zero-config deployment with GitHub integration.
